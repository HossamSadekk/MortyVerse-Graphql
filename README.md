# Morty verse ðŸ‘½
It is an application using apollo garphql with multi module and clean architecture for fetching rick and morty characters and navigate to details for each character and also search for character.
</br>
 ## Multi-Module Architecture by Layer
### Overview
The multi-module architecture by layer is an architectural approach that structures a software project into separate modules based on functional layers. Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the application, promoting modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
</br>
### Key Principles
- __Separation of Concerns__ : Modules are organized based on the separation of concerns, with each module focusing on a specific layer of functionality. This separation helps in isolating responsibilities and making the codebase more comprehensible.
- __Independence and Reusability__ : Modules are designed to be independent, allowing for better encapsulation and reusability of code. Each layer can be reused in different contexts or projects, contributing to a more modular and extensible codebase.
- __Scalability__ :  As the project grows, it becomes easier to scale and maintain by adding or modifying modules within specific layers without affecting other parts of the application. This allows for a more agile development process.
